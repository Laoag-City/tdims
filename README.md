## Tricycle Driver ID Management System

Tricycle Driver ID Management System (TDIMS) is a web app developed to address the issue of the unorganized way of keeping track of tricycle driver records of Laoag City (e.g. records in an Excel file with no standard formatting of data, manual way of knowing when a tricycle franchise will expire). Developed using Laravel. Front-end UI designed using Bulma CSS.

Features:

 1. Entry of Tricycle Driver information with driver type classification (barangay or city driver) and ID photo upload.
 2. System generated ID number based on the total number of drivers depending upon the chosen driver type.
 3. Keeps track of the every driver's ID expiration based on a renewal month and ID series.
 4. Allows every driver to have multiple ID Control numbers. This keeps track of a lost ID by associating an ID Control number to the latest replacement ID.
 5. Enables the encoder to print a driver's ID by using a background image as the ID design and HTML and CSS to display the driver's information.
